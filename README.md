Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to get the development environment running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
PHP (v8.2 or higher)

Composer

A supported database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

Node.js and NPM (if using a frontend build tool like Vite)

1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/lycheang/[your-repo-name].git
cd [your-repo-name]
2. Install PHP Dependencies
bash
composer install
3. Configure Environment
Copy the example environment file:

bash
cp .env.example .env
Generate an application key:

bash
php artisan key:generate
Open the .env file and configure your database connection settings:

env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
4. Run Database Migrations and Seeders
Run the migrations to create the database tables:

bash
php artisan migrate
(Optional) Seed the database with sample data:

bash
php artisan db:seed
5. Install NPM Dependencies and Build Assets (If Applicable)
If your project uses a frontend like Vite:

bash
npm install
npm run dev
6. Start the Development Server
bash
php artisan serve
The application will now be available at http://localhost:8000.

Usage
Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

If seeded, you may log in with a default user (e.g., admin@example.com / password).

Use the API endpoints by sending requests to /api/ routes. (Consider linking to API documentation if you have it).

API Documentation
If your project includes an API, detail how to interact with it here. You can also link to a Postman collection or dedicated API docs.

Example Endpoint:

http
GET /api/tasks
Authorization: Bearer {your_api_token}
